üìå Project Overview
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming agriculture by automating processes like rice variety classification, which is critical for ensuring quality and economic value‚Äîespecially in rice-producing regions like Turkey.

This project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify rice grains based on visual features such as shape, color, and texture. By replacing traditional manual inspection methods with a deep learning approach, we aim to:

Improve classification efficiency and accuracy

Minimize human errors

Boost reliability in rice production pipelines

üìÅ Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and consists of:

5 rice varieties: Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag

15,000 images per class (total: 75,000 images)

Features: 12 morphological, 4 shape, and 90 color features per sample

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
Data Analysis: Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Version Control: Git, GitHub

üß† Model Development and Evaluation
1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
Loaded 75,000 labeled images covering five rice types

Ensured a balanced dataset for training

2. Data Splitting
Randomized and split into:

Training: 70%

Validation: 15%

Testing: 15%

3. Normalization & Augmentation
Normalized pixel values

Applied Image Augmentation using ImageDataGenerator (rotations, zoom, flips) to enhance model generalization

4. CNN Architecture
Convolutional layers for feature extraction

Max-pooling for dimensionality reduction

Fully connected layers for classification

Activation functions: ReLU (hidden), Softmax (output)

Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy

Optimizer: Adam
